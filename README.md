Clone Repository
----------------

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zebraf1/Kassa.git
```

Installation
------------

Vendors are installed via composer. See https://getcomposer.org/download/ for updated installation guide.

Install vendors for project:
```bash
php composer.phar install
```

Note: if you install composer to a runnable directory (ie --install-dir=/usr/bin) and set --filename=composer:
```bash
composer install
```

At the end of the installation fill in parameters (saved to .env.local)

Install nodejs packages
```bash
npm install bower polymer-cli
```

App is started from public/index.php. Ensure this is the entry point configured by web server.
For Apache there is a public/.htaccess file which configures all traffic to index.php.
ModRewrite must be enabled. Find your Apache config file (httpd.conf) and make sure to have these enabled:
```
LoadModule alias_module modules/mod_alias.so
LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
```

Database
--------

Build database if needed or run sql manually
```
mysql> create database kassa
```
Create database tables by running all statements in default.sql:
```bash
mysql < app/propel/sql/default.sql
```

Run migrations
```bash
php bin/console TODO for doctrine
```

Build frontend - bower installs packages, polymer builds code
```bash
cd src/Rotalia/FrontendBundle/Resources/source/
bower prune
bower install
bower update
polymer build
```

Deploy new version: composer install, propel build, assets install, bower install, polymer build
```bash
sh build.sh # TODO: Doctrine
```

Testing
-------

Run unit and functional tests with PHPUnit

```bash
php bin/phpunit tests
```

See coverage:
```bash
cd tests/coverage/Rotalia/API
open index.html
```

Add fields to a model:
```bash
php bin/console make:entity
```

Import fixtures to local database (add --env=test if needed):
